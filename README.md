# ROB311
Course work and codes for ROB311 â€” Artificial Intelligence

Assignment #1: State Space Search
- Implement and analyze uninformed and informed search strategies for different problem domains
- basic uninformed search strategies on an explicit graph
- implement A* for 2D maze domain and analyze difficulty of random problem instances
- Code:
- breadth_first_search.py: breatdh first search algorithm for problem domains with uniform action costs
- bidirectional_search.py: a bidirectional BFS algorithm that simultaneously searches from the initial and goal states until intersection is found
- a_star_search.py: a best first search that computes the optimal paths when supplied with a consistent heuristic for its prooblem domain
